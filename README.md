# MakeShitFartist
This bot will most likely not receive any further updates, as I'm working to rewrite this bot from scratch, so I can get rid of a bunch of unnecessary and bad code.

# Credentials
This uses iFunny, Reddit, Trello, and Discord of course
You will need to create a tokens.json file in the main branch in the following format
```json

{
  "discord": "discord token",

  "trello": {
    "api_key": "api key",
    "token": "token",
    "api_secret": "secret"
  },

  "ifunny": {
    "email": "email",
    "password": "password"
  },

  "reddit": {
    "client_id": "client id",
    "client_secret": "client secret",
    "user_agent": "user agent"
  }
}
```
